\item{n.chain}{number of MCMC sampling chains}

\item{n.adapt}{number of adaptive iterations}

\item{n.burn}{number of iterations to discard before sampling of chains begins (burn in)}

\item{n.samp}{number of iterations to sample each chain}

\item{n.thin}{interval to thin samples}

\item{parallel}{logical indicating whether or not to run MCMC chains in parallel or sequentially (default = FALSE)}

\value{
dataframe giving input data along with estimates of travel probability for each location

\description{
This function fits a hierarchical model that estimates the probability an individual travels outside their home location
within the time period of the survey (tau). The model estimates both the overall population-level probability of travel (tau_pop) and 
the origin-level probability of travel (tau_i). Further this method is designed for sparse observations that typically result from 
travel survey data, where unobserved routes of travel regress to the population mean.
